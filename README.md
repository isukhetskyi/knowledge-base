# Welcome to my knowledge hub!

This repository is a living "digital garden" where I save and summarize compelling articles, posts, and documentation I encounter.

Instead of just a list of links, I add brief summaries and key takeaways for each entry. This helps me solidify my understanding and makes it a useful reference for the future.

You'll find content primarily focused on my professional interests—like **system design**, **C#**, and **cloud-native development**—but anything I find a "good read" might end up here. Feel free to browse!

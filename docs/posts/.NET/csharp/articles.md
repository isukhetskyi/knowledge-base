Reliable software testing is essential for quality, but poorly written tests—especially those causing false positives—can be more harmful than no tests at all. The article outlines five key rules for creating effective, maintainable tests.

1.  **No Conditions or Loops:** Tests must remain pure. Avoid `if` statements or `for` loops, as they add logic and complexity. Instead of testing multiple scenarios in a loop, separate each case into its own distinct test.

2.  **Use the AAA Pattern:** Structure every test using **Arrange** (set up all necessary data), **Act** (call a *single* function to be tested), and **Assert** (validate the outcome). If you feel the need to use this pattern more than once, the test should be split.

3.  **Clear Naming Conventions:** Test names serve as crucial, living documentation. Use descriptive patterns inspired by Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), such as `Should[ResultExpected]_When[CaseTested]` or `Given[InitialCondition]_When[CaseTested]_Then[ResultExpected]`.

4.  **Improve Assertion Readability:** Employ libraries like **FluentAssertions** to make validation logic more natural and human-readable (e.g., `actual.Should().Be(expected)` is clearer than `Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual)`).

5.  **Use Mocks Sparingly:** Mocks are necessary for isolating unit tests from external dependencies (like databases or APIs). However, mocking complex *internal* classes is a "red flag" indicating that the internal class itself is poorly designed and should be refactored.

System design interviews are 45-60 minute, open-ended sessions where candidates are given a broad prompt, such as "Design Instagram," to assess their ability to create scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems.

Interview expectations vary significantly by level. 

**Entry-level** candidates face basic questions (e.g., "Design TinyURL") and are judged on foundational reasoning and clear communication, not a production-ready design. 

**Mid-level** engineers must drive the conversation, discussing scaling, data flow, and fault tolerance for systems like a newsfeed. 

**Senior/Staff** engineers tackle complex distributed systems (e.g., collaborative docs), must own the entire design process, and deeply analyze trade-offs and edge cases.

Interviews cover High-Level Design (HLD)—the overall architecture, components, and data flows—and Low-Level Design (LLD)—the implementation details like classes, APIs, and data models. Seniors focus on HLD, while mid-level candidates typically cover both.

The article provides common "Design X" questions (e.g., messaging apps, file-sharing systems) and foundational knowledge questions for juniors (e.g., "What is a CDN?," "SQL vs. NoSQL?").

A successful preparation strategy involves learning core concepts (caching, sharding, load balancing) and applying a 4-step framework:
1.  **Ask clarifying questions** to define scope.
2.  **Create a high-level design.**
3.  **Drill down** on key components.
4.  **Bring it all together,** discussing trade-offs.

Experts stress that practicing mock interviews out loud is critical for mastering communication and problem-scoping.

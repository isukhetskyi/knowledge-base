Pressing "Send" in ChatGPT initiates a multi-step process, starting with a secure HTTPS request. On the server, the system builds a **context** (including conversation history and system instructions) and converts the user's text into **tokens**. This tokenized input is fed to a transformer model, which uses self-attention to understand relevance and generate a response by predicting one token at a time.

This response is immediately **streamed** back to the browser in small chunks, creating the familiar "typing" effect.

Several other key processes run in parallel to support this interaction:
* **Safety Guardrails**: A multi-layered system checks the incoming prompt, ensures the model itself is aligned to avoid restricted topics, and filters the final output.
* **Tool Calling**: The model can pause generation to call external tools, like a weather API or code interpreter, and then integrate those results into its response.
* **Memory**: An optional feature retrieves relevant, saved user details and adds them to the context for a personalized response.
* **Performance**: To operate at a massive scale, the system uses optimizations like **batching** (grouping requests for GPU efficiency), **caching** (reusing parts of the prompt's internal state), and streaming.
